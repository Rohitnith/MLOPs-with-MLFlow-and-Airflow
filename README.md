# MLOps using MLFlow and Airflow

### Problem Statement
- Code pro is an edtech startup that had a phenomenal seed A funding round. They used this funding to gain significant market share by campaigning aggressively. Due to aggressive campaigns the amount of junk leads increased.
- A lead is generated when any person visits Code proâ€™s website and enters their contact details on the platform. A junk lead is when the person sharing his contact details has no interest in the product/service.
- Having junk leads in the pipeline creates a lot of inefficiency in the sales process. Thus the goal of the Data Science team is to build a system that categorizes leads on their propensity to purchase Code pros course. This system will help remove the inefficiency caused by junk leads in the sales process.
- Our main task is to design a MLOps system using MLFlow and Airflow to effectively implement solution on live data which can effectively tackle problem of Data Drift etc.
